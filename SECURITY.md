# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Do NOT report security vulnerabilities via public GitHub Issues.**

Use GitHub Security Advisories for private reporting:
https://github.com/randomm/vipune/security/advisories/new

This ensures responsible disclosure and gives maintainers time to address the issue before public announcement.

If you cannot access GitHub Advisories, check the repository profile for additional contact information.

## What to Include

When reporting a vulnerability, include:
- **Description**: What is the vulnerability?
- **Steps to Reproduce**: How can it be triggered?
- **Impact**: What could an attacker do? Is it exploitable in practice?
- **Affected Versions**: Which versions of vipune are affected?
- **Suggested Fix** (optional): Do you have a fix in mind?

## Response Timeline

vipune is an open-source project maintained on a best-effort basis.

We will:
- **Acknowledge** your report within 7 days (where possible)
- **Assess** the vulnerability's impact and urgency
- **Work** on a fix in coordination with you
- **Publish** a security advisory once a fix is released

Response time depends on maintainer availability and issue complexity. For critical vulnerabilities (CVSS 9.0+), we aim for expedited handling.

## Public Disclosure

Once a patch is ready:
1. Release a new version with the security fix
2. Allow users **30 days** from release to upgrade before public announcement
3. Publish a public security advisory describing the vulnerability
4. Credit the reporter (unless requested otherwise)

This embargo period gives users time to patch before attackers learn of the issue.
